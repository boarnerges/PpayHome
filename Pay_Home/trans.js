Hallelujah. Matthew 28, verse 18 to 20, what I conclude I say is in the bconnections this morning. We've had a few weeks and some sessions on this. Wmake an own ground this morning. I am a bit stinking. I have some other thisay about the book, but I'll get out and find a way to do it some otherMatthew 28, verse 18. Jesus spoke to them and said, Lord of all things, given unto me in heaven and in be with me therefore and teach all nations, by pious in name and in the name of the Father, and the Son of the Holy teaching them to observe all things whatsoever, I'll command you and learn with you always, even unto the end world. Praise the Lord. And so they picked out the two words here and said, Jesus obviously gave his disciples a way to teach the Old Testwhich is the digasco, where we have the didache, you know, we've done all that synod. We also said that the Old Testament therefore must be studied Christology. John called Jesus the Word, the Logos. I said Logos is study, or subject, or revelation, or thoughts, or idJesus is the Logos of God in the Old Testament. So when you hear the word of God, you can just put the study oWhen you have biology, you have sociology, that's why you have the word Logos. So the Bible is a Christology, Christ's study of God in the Old TestIn John 5.39, he says, you touch the scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life, but they are there to testify You will not come to me that you may have love, John 5.39 and 40. In John 5.45, he says, think where I've come to accuse you before the FThere's one other accusation before the Father, according to Moses in whom you trust. He says, have you believed Moses, you have believfor he rules concerning me, John 5.45 and 46. And so therefore, it shows that the study of tTestament only becomes useful when it's a Christology, a Christ's study. And Jesus did just that on the road to Ewhen he met two of the disciples, one of them was Cleopas in Luke 24, and then he sent to them in 25 old foes and slow to believe all that the prophet has spoken of, not Christ, but suffer these things and to enter into his Pay attention to that. In 27, he now says, begin Moses and all the prophets, that's the entire Old Testament he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things that are new, which means to interpret or to show the meaning, things concerning hiNow, I also let you know that you will hardly find the word Christ in the Old Testament. So the word Christ, therefore, is an interpretWhen you look at events that are alike, about the personality that is alike, and then they show, oh, this pMoses, he has hope, he will deliver, he will set free, he will bring us to this, he will heal, he will set free, he will rid us of boand you see that person, spoken of from Genesis through to Malachi, then he must be the Messiah, the Christus, the CSo that calling Jesus the Christ is an interpretation of the scriptures, of the Old TestAnd so that means that when the pieces were written, they were written as a Christology, a ChristNow Christology, Christology, of course we have different studies in that. We have the theology, that's the study of God in Christ asWe have the new mythology, which is the study of the spirit, of spirits geneWe have the ecclesiology. Ecclesiology is the study of the church, gatherings, and the systems of worship, you know, ecclesiWe have all of that. We also have what we call the eschatology. Eschatology is the study of events of the last days, youWe have, okay, some people believe we have a pistology, the study of faith, but I don't really subscribe toWe have ecclesiology, we have new mythology, we have theology, we have eschatology, all just a study all in CBecause the moment it leaves the Christology, then you are studying apart from Jesus already gave us a way to study the Old Testament. It's a Christology where you interpret the Old Testament to find CRemember I told you that you don't read the Old Testament for us in our deNot that there are all of people's minds when we call it the You study the Word to find out what it sees, not what youSo when God is writing to Colossi, it is not writing to Colossi from the book of ColosIt is writing to Colossi from the Old Testament. In other words, he is explaining the Old Testament toSo every epistle is an Old Testament scripture interpretation or explanThe epistles therefore explain the Old Testament. It's not there, and it's not We gave from background checks on Colossians. The first thing we said was it was a church that Paul did not personally estaWe also said it was a church, he didn't even see them, he hadn't been there bSo this book presents a scenario for you and I when we have people that we teach with mentor, either directly or indirectly, how do you handleWhat do you say to them? And we said, for example, that the content of the book doesn't differ from any otheThere was nothing emotional, there was nothing sentimental, nothing familiar, it's just all goodIn fact, I asked you to look at Ephesians and put together with Colossians and see that the contents are very much So in Colossi, he writes to them, what we call the book of Colossians, in Colossians 1 He says, I got to know about you on a land of Epiphas, again, chapter 7, which is for you, a faithful minister of Christ who had declared unto us your love in the SSo we got to know about them through Epiphas. Epiphas obviously was Paul's disSo Paul's disciple then led Ephesians to establish this church, which is the fruit of disciplWe often say that the fruit of ministry is ministry iIn Colossians chapter 2, and those two obviously had seen them bHe says in chapter 1, this one, sorry, for I hope that you knew the great conflict I have for you and for them at Laoand for as many as I have not seen my face in the flesh. That's the nature of this cSo whatever he is addressing, he is addressing it because Epiphas must have toleither Epiphas alone, Epiphas with Onesimus, or someone like Philemon, those who were in paand there were also leaders in that church. But I think it's just Epiphas, rAnd so he writes to them, and I identified to you that Colossae is like LaoMoracor, Abudja, very benign, where different people from different parts of the coor Africa, Johannesburg, or maybe Accra, and all those places where you will find many tmany people, many nationals, where you will find many professions, many businAnd then when that happens, it's not strange to also find many belief sySo Colossae, therefore, became like a constituent of different belief syDifferent people who believe different things. Now somehow, just like Cothose things were finding their way into the churches. And believers can't adopt belief sdifferent from the Gospel. And so what they were now doing was they were mixing them togWe'll call them syncretism. That is, different belief systems, you don't want to merge them togAnd so they thought, well, Christ is, yes, our Savior, but then there's a sense in There's a kind of sense in the global message. Science is saying something that makes a lot of And then you go back and say, well, I also did some study in Jehovah's WitnI think they have some in there. You know, that kind of thought pattern was what was now present in ColSo Paul had to write a letter to show and emphasize the superiority of the Christ revelation oand not just the superiority, the singularity. The similarity of Christ's revelation of God and the singularity And so that was the emphasis of the letter. And we checked a bit of that yesthow he addressed three different things in chapter two. Chapter two, from verse four orhe addressed some in verse eight, then another one in verse 16 and 17, then also from verse 18 So it was like a church. There are different things beneath. And you know, in modern day it's typical cosmopolitan places where, you know, you are exposed to knowledge of all So that's why there's a lot of discussion on knowledge in Colossae. You have knowledge of all So you are mixing things up. You have the knowledge of that world someYou have the knowledge of some religion somewhere. You have something that you read on the internet someAnd you know, you just pick up thoughts. And I showed you yesterday that there's no knowledge that's neYou pick up thoughts here and there. And then you find out, how can I merge this with scriThat's absolutely wrong. Christ is all and in all. And that's the whole difference here in ColSo we've already gone through all of that. And we finally went in chapter three and verAre you there? All right, chapter three and verVery keen with what he says in verse 11, where there's neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision or uncircumcBarbarian, Scythian, wonderfully, where Christ is all and iI said that Barbarian is the fellow who is a foreigner or is a phrase for an uneducated psomebody who is unlettered, is basically what you can call an illitThe Scythian is a bit more, really, someone who is a little strong, yousomeone who doesn't sit among the elites. And then Paul says there's nothing like that in CNow, if you did a study with us last year, which part of the book did Paul address this strWho can remind me? WhicYou didn't say about my teacher. WhicLast year, the man appointed to deal with inequI got this. What is that? Parliament. VeryWere you around? Oh, you heard about it? You were aYou were? You heard from her. So you now remOkay. That's another way to tell the truth, All right, that's second-hand revelation. That'sOkay. But what's similar here is that the parliament and currency were in the same The parliament was also an elder in currency. So that means that he had to deal withAnd you see, when we come to a city and then the church starts to risk becoming eliand we're allowing the society to replace what So Paul had to deal with that in currency. I wrote this into the parliThen you see, you can be an M.D., you can be a governor, you can be a presBut when you come among saints, that fellow is not your brSo he said, that means the ecclesiast is where God breaks the inequality in the soAnd I'll give you an example of what Paul is teachingThere's no Greek, no Jew. There's no Sathosite, no SathThere's no Scythian, no Alameda yet. No governor.

the Bible.Sit down there, sit down there, sit down there,take your Bible.Yeah, give me some of this thing.Ha ha ha ha.Ha ha ha ha.Hallelujah.There's some passers-by who cry to the child.They want their children to stop,to review again quickly.I don't do that.Not at all.You learn from my example, and your mother,and you see from the Word of God, and other believers,and you make your choice.Praise the Lord.You don't force people to know God.It's not done.Moses did not even succeed.You can't succeed.You only reach 10,000 people who do not pretend.You focus.You don't even know the rule.You're done.Ha ha ha ha ha.Hallelujah.Glory be to God.Say a good word in all things.In the Holy Trinity, say so much, that and praise.We have a teaching series on this,the New Creation and its Relationships.You can get it.And also the book for this course, I know it's out.I will stop, we should get it out by cap meeting.It's coming to a day, in all things,your masters are holding to the flesh.No one else has this.As many preachers, as many preachers,by a seediness of heart towards God.This is a vast, many believers keep.Ha ha ha ha.Believe that?And this coming, and this coming, and this coming.What are you guys doing?Nothing's happening.It's not blitzkrieg's second book.This is, you obey, now, I think this will be a new paragraph.Okay, not yet, let's leave it at that.Not yet, not yet.When it says, not as, not for our service,it is a word for optics.It actually uses the word ophthalmologyin the Greek, ophthalmology, not phermology.O-P-T-H-A-L-M-O-D-I-L-I-A.D-O-I-L-I-A.It means not to be seen.In other words, the Christian conductis to do behind your boss what you dowhen he or she is there.Not Christian conduct.Not for the eyes.As many pleasers.But it says, there is singleness of heart.Fare you.Fare you?No.Fare those fears.That is, it's for the awe of God.Not as many pleasers.Now, I know people have an actor for saying this.Now, why would he say that?That serving the man is like serving God.That's not what he's saying.You are picking up the key instruction there.The key instruction there is that Christians are not hypocrites.That's the key thing there.You haven't said you shouldn't leave your job.You haven't said you shouldn't get another one.He said, but when you are there,you mustn't be someone who does something behindanother one before.That's not Christian.Now, you could be dissatisfied with the job and change it.In 1 Corinthians 7, he said, if you have the energyto increase your income and get yourself freefrom your employment, he said, do your best to do that.1 Corinthians 7, he says that.But he's saying, if you are somewhere, you are walking there,they should know you.Their yes is your yes.Your no is your no.What you do before your boss is not differentfrom what you do there.See, it's not a mere instruction.It's Christian living.Don't say it's wisdom.It's not all wisdom you're talking about.It's wisdom.Wisdom, oh, it's wisdom.Let's be careful.It's wisdom.So, the way you trust in the office,if you put all those words together,they're not up to your prior life in one year.lights out.You're smoking out of their liveson the first day before you start.You can break from it.What about from the light,if you're Anton Incorporated.You create a ISTAAC, it's a least title.You gotta have money to buy security.We took builders and credit cards here,where we go and do the warm ups.And I'm talking about move.all of these people are doing it a little better.This is going out with the enemy, okay?exploitation and exploitation and everybody!epidemictrueis this over there truce?Is this over there truce?Is it over there?This one breaks.Someone laughs at it.Is he trying to laugh at you?Are you trying to laugh?Look at what I'm seeing.You're looking across the whole for your partner.That's me, right?It makes no sense.The same bullet of past.So where is that same bullet of apostasy that is your straightforward?It has nothing to do with who your partner is.They are not originally like that.But when you are there, be a Christian.Hallelujah.Be a Christian.Soises of rising of the ladder.No enemy in the whole place.Mark them out.Keep that at the right time.Measure your speech.No one can hit back.You're in and out.They're not like this one.Christ has to be superior.Are you there?And whatever you do, do is how?Do it with your whole self.It uses a lot of soul.Do it with yourself.Do it with yourself.That is, if you're not expected by Christians to be ineffective at work,do it with all of your heart.Resume that type of work.Everybody resumes.They gave you something to do in the open.Go and get that seesaw.You can have your associates.I'll deal with all of this one by one.And then every time, who do you give it up to be there?You're supposed to have a boss in world media.Oh, boy!Yay!And then the whole office is filled with little world media.So you have to have your genesis.Something's wrong with your genesis.If I'm your boss, I'll sack you.Are you applying my teaching?I was like, does this look like self-seminity?Hey, man.So I was like, hey, man.I'm not going to run out of time.I'm not going to allow that.Do it actively.Work well.Be effective.Do it well.Ask to the Lord and work with me.Wow.You know, I told you that working for a Christian is part of his Christian life.You know, I told you.Part of your Christian life.Dignity and dignity of labor is Christian character.Sorry, I love when some preachers say, because they're not of good, you know what?Where did you get that from?I had already been to work at the ministry.That's why I didn't work.Seriously?We'll go through that later.I've touched on that before anyway.That's why I didn't do it.No way!Look at 24.I want us with that 24 to get out of the church.Oh yeah, let's look.24.That of the Lord, you shall receive the reward of the inheritance, for you serve the Lord Christ.Like 25.He that doeth wrong shall receive from the Lord, which is at God.And there is no respect or pressure.How about that?In your office.This is not stuff.This is not evangelism.In your office.It is the work, and for purposes, you will receive reward of inheritance.The inheritance you have, in question I won't talk.That means the inheritance that we have in Christ will be working within our office,in our jobs, in our payment.We have a reward for it.You are not receiving a reward for being an effective lookout.You are receiving a reward for serving the Lord in the office, in the home of your house.Being honest, being Christian.That means people say you are working in the Spirit.It's not only among believers.It's also in your job.As a truth that has gone wrong, it says the same thing.It uses the word, unusual.It says, she will receive, by 25, the work you have done wrong.The same, in several countries, five times, an efficient sixth step, a first with a third line.If you act badly, you receive the worst reward.God will condemn what you have done.So, it's not just what you do in your church, or your unit, or your fellowship.It's also what you do at work, what you do at home.The knowledge of Christ must dominate your conduct, totally.So, one man will work for salaries alone.Your mind should be on the Lord Jesus Christ.Out of the Joseph's polynomial in the law, you bear the consequences.See, there's no partiality, no respect of persons.It now uses Romans 2, 1, 2, 11, verses 6 and 9, and Romans 2, 1.There is no respect of persons.But the next layer, so let me explain, P-R-O-S-O, P-O-L-E-M-S-I-A.Similar to what Peter said in Acts chapter 34.God is no respecter of persons.So, going back to that material, the new creation and his relations, we dealt with many things.Husband and wife, children and parents, wife to husband, you and your in-laws, we dealt with all of that.We also mentioned employer, employee, business partners, citizens and the nation.I think we had 13 or 14 sessions.That was about 10 years ago, about 8 years ago.We talked that and then we listened to it again.So, you cannot get away with bad conduct because you think it's not in the thoughts.No. You have to be a Christian everywhere.Praise the Lord. Very good.Chapter 4, verse 1. I believe chapter 4, verse 1 should be in chapter 3.Because it's dealing with the same thing.Masters, give unto yourselves that which is just and equal,being that you also have a master in heaven.The word just, there's a word added here that is righteous.What is that?In other words, pay them what is due.Pay them what is due.Pay them what is right.You've got work. You've got all your staff.It's not about NLC.It's not about liberal fight. No.It's about Christian living.And you know, God also gives a warning, let's just take that one, that's just by the way,but so both of us who work with Christians, you know you can take advantage of the Christian boss.First of all, in chapter 6, he gives us an instruction on that.You can say, well, you know what?That's all I want to understand.Or that's all I want to understand.I work with evangelism.I work with only God.In chapter 6, verse 2.There they are, the living masters.Let them not despise them because they are bravery.They rather do them service because they are faithful and below,partakers of the benefits.Do not take advantage.Or the fact that your boss is a Christian, they'll do an undue.Hallelujah.I said, hallelujah.I will tell you something here.So if I were to say this would be a different paragraph entirely,then it says, continuing prayer and watching the same good things given.That's another paragraph.We've got a friend for us, a good love one unto us,a guy who wants us to speak the mystery of Christ for which I'm also in bondage.That's all.That I will make it manifest that I ought to speak what can reason to usand I without redeeming the time.Let your speech be always with grace, season with salt,that you may know how you ought to answer every man.That's a different paragraph.Now notice what it says, continuing prayer.It's first category, V-R-O-S-K-T-R-E-O.You know that word by now.It means continue where you have begun.There is a signature in all the Course Letters, an instruction to always pray.Officials seek certain prayer in all ways.Romans 12, 12 being instant in prayer.Colossians 11, verse 5, 17.Prayer without season.8, verse 5, 6.Blanches for nothing.And in prayer and supplication with hands given,let your request be made known to God.It's something to ourselves all the time.So prayer is part of Christian living.You know, it doesn't say,prayer because you have a problem.Prayer is part of our work with God.If you have to know why you should pray,or have a program before you pray,or have a demand in materiality before you pray,you don't know what prayer is.You don't know what it is.So if it is prayer for us, prayer for the ministers of the Gospel,a very key reason why we pray.The door of excellence.What is the door of excellence?The door of excellence is boldness.To say things clearly.The door of excellence is boldness.To say the word as you ought to say it.Acts 4.Acts 4, verse 29.Grown to your servant's boldness,that no boldness will speak thy word.Acts 4, verse 29.The door of excellence is the preacher of the Gospelto boldly declare what he shall say.To say what he shall say the way he ought to say.Not to be reserved, not to co-empower what he's saying,but to say it without apologies.There is no walk in wisdom.We have done that all without.That's the Sophia.Insights.Redeeming the time.Ephesians 5.16.Just like he says, because the days are in book.So that we, as believers,as believers, have a sense of urgency we have in God's Wordnot to waste time.A sense of urgency.Not to waste time.Redeeming the time, he says.Look up at 6.Let your speech be already with grace.Season with salt.Then you know how you ought to answer every man.Salt is an idiom for modestyand conserving something.Season is the word in the Greek.Atsro, A-R-T-R-O, can make it already.In other words, before you say something,as a preacher, as a Christian, season it.I told you, as believers we don't stay out of our minds.We renew it first.Then we say what we ought to say.There is nothing called freedom of speech in Christianity.You say what you ought to say.What you ought to say.Not what you like to say.What should you say?There are times, I'm not going to say there are times,you say something and people will be scared.And they will fear you, but deep down in your heartyou'll feel uncomfortable.Let me tell you something I've said that before.You'll feel uncomfortable in your heart.No, ah, ah, ah, ah.That's not right.You're born again.Season it.In other words, preserve it.You need this in the way you talk.Don't say everything.Listen carefully.I've said this before.If there's any time you shouldn't talk,is when you are provoked in angeror you are bitter about something.Before you say anything,deal with the anger.Anger is a sin.What do I say?Can you say it together?Say it again.Anger is a sin.It's not, you know, to us anger is a sin.S-E-E-N-E.In God's word, anger is S-I-N.It's a sin.It's a sin.So deal with the anger first.You may have to say, kill me.But many times when you deal with the anger,you are not saying anything to it again.Say, I'm born of God.Say, I'm born of God.Say, I'm born of God.The flesh has been crucified.Anger is not allowed in me.You are born of God.You can just be quiet.And I'm born with anger.Don't worry.Anything that is born, you cool down.Because this is what's going to happen.You are actually not right.And then you are not stupid.Deal with both.So say it as you ought to say it.Season it with salt.Make sure you conserve it.Preserve it.Hold yourself back.Hold yourself back.They are probably talking.I know what I do.You will say what you have to say.You will say anything to anybody.That's what I do.Christ has come at home.All right.All right.All right.All right.There is no justice.And there is no sin.So then it's ready.That's how it happens.So the diagnosis, you are Kana.Kana be it.No more.So the sermon, as we get to the very end of the book,it now begins to relate with individuals.In all my speech, I'll start because it's very important to youwho is a beloved brother of fellow faithful menace and servants in the Lord.I mean, these are good commendations.He calls him brother, fellow servant, faithful menace.Wow.Hallelujah.He is a successful businessman.No.Fellow servant, brother, faithful menace.Those are not words just written in a poem.It's for us to meditate on it.I'm not your brother in Christ.But I'm not your fellow servant in the belly of Christ.I'm not your faithful menace.So we can trust.You know, every one of those associates,they were full-time workers somewhere.They were either businessmen or they were entrepreneurs.All of these associates.None of those associateswasn't working for him.Yet, in spite of that, he calls his man fixed.In your own church, here in this community,can we say you are a faithful person?Faithful means someone that is reliable.It is even in the next verse,I have sent to you for the same purpose,that he may know your estates and comfort your hearts.Then the name shows in verse 9.Onissima, both of the archipelago,was the one that took the letter to Ephraim.As we are told in the beginning,he took it to the churches together.They are just, they are around the same axis.Onissima is a faithful and beloved brotherwho is one of the siblings.He calls himself faithful.He's not, what you call a believer, faithful.That means he's reliable.You are always available for service.Faithfulness is not towards God alone,it's towards me.Are you faithful?You are reliable in your church.Are you faithful?Then I mention another brother,Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, Saluti,and Marcos, sister son to Barnabas,watching when you receive commandmentand the commands you receive.Now let me talk about this.It mentions Mark.If you have read the book of Acts,you'll know that there's a markthat was with Paul on Barnabasthat Paul asked them to come back to the churches.And Barnabas insisted that he had to go.And so that was one of the reasons why they parted ways.Obviously, somehow, he had come back to Paul.You know, this is Barnabas' cousin,or, sorry, nephew, basically his sister's son.Now, this brother is quite an interesting person.Peter also mentions him.There's a district on that.He calls Peter, part 13, as Mark, my son.He's everybody's son in the Lord.He's mentioned also in 2 Timothy 4.11.It's useful for me in ministry.That's what Paul says.I'm finally on 1.24.But pay attention to something I wanted to see.Paul gave instructions that he'd be welcoming.That means the local church has authorityover your relationships.Remember, instead of the Dominions 2,he said, if there's a brother that is not givingto my instructions, don't eat with him.Huh?He puts questions like, do not eat with him.But I can choose who I want to be friends with.Friends with?No, you can't.That's strange.No, you can't.Jesus would tell his disciples, beware of thisbecause it's tough.It's not a suggestion.It's an instruction.So obviously, because of Mark was used to disaster,Paul definitely, just like we now know,are from the churches.This guy's not faithful.He always runs away and they give him battle.But somehow, I think right now,just like I told Timothy, he is now youthful in ministry.So he said, I've given an instruction.Welcome him.Hallelujah.Welcome him.In 2 Timothy chapter 4, there was someone like thatby the name of Alexander the Corpuscle,that Paul says to Timothy, 2 Timothy chapter 4,Alexander the Corpuscle chapter 14,and bound me not evil,the law and order in my country's works,of whom you should also be careful,for you have greatly mistook our words.The pastor can instruct you to be careful for someone.Anyone who can hurt Paul will hurt Timothy.That was as simple as that.So here, he says, welcome Mark back into fellowship.Take him back.Receive him.Then he mentions in verse 11,Jesus, which is called justice for circumcision,this thing here, my fellow worker in the kingdom of God,which have been a comfort unto me.Why is he mentioning this?So that you can see the examples of people to follow.There are people in a church that are exemplary.I always tell people,watch those who have been commended to you.Those are the ones that you have to take after.Not the person that invited you to church,or your cousin, or your neighbor, no, no, no.That becomes insignificant in their criteria.Look at the people commended to you.So he's saying, Archicast follow him.Lysimus follow him.Aristocrat follow him.Marcos receive him.Then he says, justice follow him.The essence of mentioning their Christian qualitiesis so that they are exemplary.And with everything I've written to you as instructions,those who will carry it out, they are faithful.Every pastor, who obviously was a pastor of the church,or you can call him the senior pastor,he is one of you, a servant of Christ,salutes you always, neighboring fervently for you in prayersthat you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.That pastor is obviously the pastor.He's mentioned in Philemon 23.He says he's praying for you.He neighbors you.He has our belief in praying for youthat you will stand in full assurance,Romans 421 and Romans 14.5.Perfect in all of the will of God.So if you are a pastor, hear me well,or if you are the disciple in Christ,your major work is prayer.As we are teaching, you must keep praying.You must keep praying.You mustn't get discouraged.You must keep praying.While things go bad, without that,standing in Christ, your prayer should go deeper.As we are teaching, keep praying.Don't have so much confidence in what you teachor get into prayer because prayer is an oilthat keeps the engine of knowledge running.Prayer is what makes the car.The car is the knowledge of the world.But the engine, whether it's the oil or the flour,is prayer.Praying for the people.He says his neighbor,firmly, that you must stand completein all of the will of God.Perfect.But then he has great zeal for you.Again, example.And then they allow them to swear in every way.So you have churches all over the place.Just in the same area.Now notice something he says about this.Monk would love to teach you,and somebody who mentions also elsewhere,2 Timothy 4, verse 10.He says, and deem us great sheep.This was before Deema's towered abode.Deema's great sheep.So another brother would say,now there's a newb here, and a child is in his house.And when he says, Christians will write about you,the word write there means,you will read in detail.And you should study it.That's what we read.And it is studied.Also, so listen,the epistles are not for you to readand you that reference.They are for you to study.I'm not Dinosco.Pay attention to details.Check the past, over and over again.What is right,is it's course,it doesn't matter because the law is here,and you write that it's written,that means the informationto all the churchesare relevant to each church,his type of location.And say to Archipos,remember,we are talking about faithful people.They have mentioned one brother,Archipos,take you to the ministry that you have received from the Lordthat you fulfill it.Archipos is a brotherthat he mentionsin another letter.Parliament.Archipos.Is it parliament?Right.I'm going to check it.I guess it'sor filament.Filament two.Archipos, a fellow soldierunder the churchin thy house.Filament two.Why would he saysay to Archipos?That means that somehowArchipos has beenloved by the churchand the churchand the churchand the churchand the churchhas beenlagging behind.He's not the Archipos we used to know.He's been unstable.And then he saysthe whole churchsay to him,what does that mean?We have a responsibilitynot to caresspeople who arechanging their commitments.As a churchwe jointlybrother, no.You used to need prayer. What's going on?Sister.And he says, you knowmy hatred beingno bitternessas unto the Lord.He's a good example.Say to Archipos.So believers don't ask ourselveswhat are you getting married?Believers don't ask ourselves.Are you getting far out?We ask ourselves.Ask ourselves.How's your Christian life?How's your spiritual life?I've not been seeing youin Kermadee.You went for evangelism on Saturday.I didn't see you.We gave to your church.You went around.When we put in another video, you weren't there.That's how Christians are.Say to Archiposthat ministrythat you have received in the Lordsee to itthat you fulfill it.And verse 20, or sorrythe very last verseverse 18in our series, that's how we saidthe structure of their letters.He says, somebody said by the hand of me, Paulremember me, my bonds,grace with you. That means rememberI am in prison.That's where he was.Let's have an overview of this bookand you know, in closing.This letter deals withthe huge systems, you know, all together.I thought I would really do thepower graphing for us. Of course, yeah.The power graphing for us for all the religions.I can do that.I'll do it some other time.I want you to power graph it for us andpick out the solution. I mean you can do that on your own.Just look at different circuit matterswhere Paul addressedthe Christian doctrine.What we commonly believein his prayer. He did it personally.Colossians 1, from about verse 9to verse 22.That's what we commonly believe.Then he notes that this is thefruit of growth, 23 to 24.Then he re-emphasizedthat assurance again in 26, 27.Then again, theimport of ministry in 28.And then 29.And then from chapter 2, you seethat again, he again told themhow important it was to be remembered. Verse 2was 1, from verse 2to verse 2 and 3 are theeye points.Where is the knowledge of God?We are all in crisis.And from verse 4, verse 5, becareful. Let no one distractyou. It basicallydetours.You are affected by different things that you believe.You need just beliefs,different kinds of knowledge systems, fine acrossthe church. And he told them tobe careful. It's a bookwhere we need to be careful of the knowledgethat we receive.I tell you, knowledge is not neutral.Knowledge has its own product.It has its ownfocus.It's a book whereyou hold on to Christ.In Romans 2,verse 18and 19, you holdon to Christ.You have 18 and 19,you hold on to Christ.Christ's knowledge becomes superior to the book.You know, the prayer, as Isaid, Paul's prayer is very differentbecause, you know, he hasn't seen them in prayer.It doesn't mean that he must personally askE. Mead, the Church of the Colons, or otherchurches in Galatia.Also, you can see whatsacredism can cause, because when you mergeyour knowledge of scriptures with the knowledge of otherbooks, suchbelievers cannot make progressin the faith.So, that's what the book is all about.To reassure believersas well as to warn them of the dangerof believingdifferent things.Also,conduct. I will say thatif you build conducton knowledge,and I'll give you a distinction betweendoing what is rightbecause it is right,and doing what is rightto the glory of God. There are two different things.Moralityand Christian living are two different things.Even though the actuals can be the same,but they are not the same.I explained that to you yesterday.And so, if you build Christian conducton the foundationof knowledge,try,try to read it again,I agree the series will be out in the week,study through it again,and then beginto walk in the truths that are there,just like Paul says, you know,the walk in the truths that are therein your relationships,also in the exposure of your mindto different kinds of information,Paul says we have to be careful.The Christian life,like I said last week,is a life of carefulness.We must be on guard.We must be carefulof the thingswe are reading,the things we are listening to,so that we can please the Lord. Amen.My best.Thank you very much.
